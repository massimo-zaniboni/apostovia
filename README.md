## Motivation

Convert swimming race results in a navigable, but static, HTML site. 

## Installation and Usage

Install Haskell Stack tool under Nix, or install only Stack without Nix, but remove Nix usage from ``stack.yaml`` file.

Execute ``./update_local_web.sh`` for compiling the tool, and generating the data.

Change the content of ``apostovia.dat`` for generating a different web-site.

## Status

The code is not polished, and it is rather old, so some work must be done in case of reuse for other projects.

## License
