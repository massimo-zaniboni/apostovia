## Motivation

Convert swimming race results in a navigable, but static, HTML site. 

## Installation and Usage


  nix-build shell.nix
  ./update_local_web.sh

Change the content of ``apostovia.dat`` for generating a different web-site.

## Status

The code is not polished, and it is rather old, so some work must be done in case of reuse for other projects.
